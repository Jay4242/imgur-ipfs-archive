# imgur-ipfs-archive
Simple scripts to crawl imgur into IPFS

## imgur-crawler.bash
This randomly guesses urls and saves them to IPFS.

## imgur-gateway.bash
This doesn't necessarily fetch any of the images but keeps track of the CIDs/Files that multiple nodes submit via the pubsub.

Example IPNS address: ipns://k51qzi5uqu5dgxeaigxsz5au2qf2jlx60ypkxh3coy7or4mqam504p7apfbq8t
